Find a solution for the vertex color check
    -> Either find out if cubic mesh colliders cost alot
    -> Find a different way (else.g. Tags)
	-> All shootables have to have a mesh collider with a certain vertex color. All other colliders are not sufficent fo placing a bridge!

Create a player!
    -> Communictaes with BridgeManager
        -> Tells him whenever he succesfully places a bridge point, only checks if the bridge point can be placed. If it will destroy a bridge has to be checked elsewhere? 
            > Maybe, if that gets checked elsewhere, I can move the logic out of the "PlaceBridgePoint" method.
Create a system that hypothetically supports multiple payers at once.
	> Make there be either a bridge manager per player or a make it have player specific data

Check if Serialization works for monobehaviours as well!

Move To High Definition Render Pipeline!
