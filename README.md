# UnderTheLight2

Under The Light 2 is a planned sequel for Under The Light.
It is currently not under active development, but available for code samples.

In this version, the user can place two points in the unity editor and on startup, a bridge mesh is created between them.
Currently, all surfaces will be seen as a mirror, so the bridge will have many segments!

See "Assets/Game" for all relevant scripting files.
